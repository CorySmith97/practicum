<pre><code>This is intrinsic to who we are. It is spiritually
“genetic,” inherited from our heavenly parents,
and requires no effort on our part. This is our most
important identity, regardless of how else we choose to 
identify ourselves. Understanding this profound truth is
important for everyone but especially for individuals belonging
to groups who have been historically marginalized, oppressed, 
or subjugated. Remember that your most important 
identity relates to your divine nature as a child of God.

<p>God gives us covenants to push us to become more than we otherwise would be. The covenant
path is a way to open the heavens to bless us in our mortal existence. Our covenants
are what allow us to become more perfect, and are the only way that we can one day become
like our beloved Father in Heaven or our Savior. The covenant path is also not an exclusive
thing, but rather anyone who is willing to accept and follow it can receive of the same blessings.
It is part of our job as disciples who are walking the covenant path to extend our arms
and raise our voices to find those whom are lost in this world and invite them to walk the path
of happiness with us. Additionally if we ever step off the path God is waiting for us to get back on.
He will help us to do so, and will be patient for however long that process takes.</p>

<pre><code>From such teachings we conclude that the Final Judgment
is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and 
evil acts—what we have done. It is based on the final 
effect of our acts and thoughts—what we have become.
We qualify for eternal life through a process of conversion.
As used here, this word of many meanings signifies a profound change of nature. 
It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. 
The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a 
list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. 
The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become
what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.

<pre><code>God wants our families to be happy and forever.
Forever is too long if we make each other unhappy.
Happy is too short if cherished relationships stop with this
life. Through sacred covenants, Jesus Christ offers His love,
power, and grace to change us18 and heal our relationships. 
Selfless temple service for dear ones makes our Savior’s
Atonement real for them and us. Sanctified, we can return
home to God’s presence as families united eternally.

<pre><code>If your faith in Jesus Christ has led to a heart
softened through the effects of His Atonement, you will
be more able to feel the whisperings of the Spirit in answer 
to your prayers. My personal experience is that the still, 
small voice—which is real—is clear and discernible in my mind
when I feel an internal quiet and submission to the
Lord’s will. That feeling of humility can be 
best described as “Not my will, but thine, be done.”

<pre><code>Elder J. Golden Kimball is purported to have said,
“I may not have [always] walked the straight and narrow,
but I [try] to cross it as often as I [can].”5 In a more
serious moment, I am sure Brother Kimball would agree that
staying on, not just crossing, the covenant path is our
greatest hope for avoiding avoidable misery on the one hand and successfully 
dealing with the unavoidable woes of life on the other.

<pre><code>When there was a controversy in the early Church regarding who was
entitled to heaven’s blessings and who wasn’t, the Lord declared to the
Prophet Joseph Smith, “Verily I say unto you, [the gifts of God] are 
given for the benefit of those who love me and keep … my commandments, 
and [for them] that seeketh so to do.” Boy, aren’t we all thankful for that
added provision “and … seeketh so to do”! That has been a lifesaver because
sometimes that is all we can offer! We take some solace in the fact that if
God were to reward only the perfectly faithful, He wouldn’t have much of a distribution list.

<pre><code>The closer we are to Jesus Christ in the thoughts and intents of our hearts,
the more we appreciate His innocent suffering, the more grateful we are for 
grace and forgiveness, and the more we want to repent and become like Him. 
Our absolute distance from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is important, 
but the direction we are heading is even more crucial. God is more pleased 
with repentant sinners who are trying to draw closer to Him than with self-righteous, faultfinding individuals who, 
like the Pharisees and scribes of old, do not realize how badly they need to repent.

<p>In this life, God wants nothing more than to be our biggest fan and to support us.
He has provided a median for us to truly succeed. This includes following his voice piece.
Prophets have been provided out of love to help us to follow God and get better
support from him. In order to do this however it requires work from us. Some of these
aspects are not easy however. If we want to let God prevail in our lives, this requires us
to be willing to be chastened. For God chastises those he loves. That includes us. Letting
God prevail requires work and sometimes growth in order to receive more love and fulfillment.
The only way to end this life and return with him is to let him prevail here while we are
in the time of our trial, but it is something that will bring us joy as we work towards it.</p>

Thus, the antidote to Satan’s scheme is clear: we need daily

Christ to be heard.6 As we abide in God’s love, we depend
less and less on the approval of others to guide us.

hearken. It means “to listen with the intent to obey.”
To hearken means to “hear Him”—to hear what the Savior says

gives us the pattern for success, happiness, and 
joy in this life. We are to hear the words of the Lord,
hearken to them, and heed what He has told us!

He shares that perspective with us through His commandments,

 Paul said of divine correction or chastening, “For whom the Lord

<p>Upon finishing and reviewing this section of scripture that I have found
I feel impressed that if I am to continually find joy in repentance, I need to
strive to cherish those things that Christ has done for me that allow me to repent.
These things include the atoning sacrifice he made for all of us. The main way I need to
remember his sacrifice is through the sacrament. However it is not as simple as
merely taking the sacrament each week, but it comes from communicating with
the Lord prior to renewing my covenants. It also comes from being as prepared
as I can be for the ordinance on a weekly basis. I should arrive early, and
participate. Listen to the speakers and the music. Another impression I have
had is that I can pray that the Lord will continually fill me with the Joy of repentance
as I participate daily in the practice. I feel strongly that the Lord will bless me to find
the Joy of repentance daily once again.</p>

<pre><code>Of course, we all have some habits or flaws or personal
history that could keep us from complete spiritual immersion
in this work. But God is our Father and is exceptionally

In any case, there is divine help for every one of

we allow the atoning sacrifice of Christ to become wholly effective in our life.

<pre><code>Even after sincere repentance, however, we may stumble.
Stumbling does not mean that the repentance was inadequate 
but may simply reflect human weakness. How comforting to know 
that “the Lord sees weaknesses differently than He [sees] 
rebellion.” We should not doubt the Savior’s ability to help us with our weaknesses, because “when the 
Lord speaks of weaknesses, it is always with mercy.”

<pre><code>Consecration therefore means repentance. Stubbornness, rebellion,
and rationalization must be abandoned, and in their place submission,
a desire for correction, and acceptance of all that the Lord may require. 
This is what King Benjamin called putting off the natural man, yielding
to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and becoming “a saint through the
atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). Such a one is promised
the enduring presence of the Holy Spirit, a promise remembered 
and renewed each time a repentant soul partakes of the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper

Prophet and … to the Church, when it would have been so easy to have disintegrated in 
bitterness.” In the spring of 1840, he presented himself at a general conference,
humbly asking forgiveness for his past conduct and expressing his determination to do the will of God in the future. His case was presented 
by Hyrum Smith, and he was freely forgiven. He died a faithful member of the Church.

we must remember and reverence the sacrament. It allows each of us to express
with broken hearts and contrite spirits our willingness to follow the

The sacrament allows us to witness to God that we will remember His
Son and keep His commandments as we renew our baptismal covenant.

<p>The scriptures are the Lord's counsel for the world. Without the daily
immersion of the scriptures how can we ever truly come to know the
Lord. The Book of Mormon is God's most pure form of written word. God
expects us and has counseled us on countless occasions that we should
imemerse ourselves in these words. When we want to speak with the Lord we
pray, but when we want the Lord to speak with us we should open the scriptures.
One of the most important things I was reminded in this topic is that we have
prophetic promises that as we read the Book of Mormon daily, we will make better
decisions daily. Another important thing is that if the apostles have need to
study daily we have just as large a need to do the same. There is also profound
promises that reading the scriptures with those we love will improve relationships
and bring peace into families or households.</p>

ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, 
and you will receive answers to your own questions and 
direction for your own life. I promise that as you daily 
immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized 
against the evils of the day, even the gripping

reservoir of living water to which we have ready access 
and from which we can drink deeply and long. You and 
I must look to and come unto Christ, who is “the fountain

by reading (see Mosiah 1:5), studying (see D&amp;C 26:1), 
searching (see John 5:39; Alma 17:2), and feasting (see 2 Nephi 32:3) 
upon the words of Christ as contained in the holy scriptures. 
By so doing, we can receive both spiritual
direction and protection during our mortal journey.

<pre><code>With that promise in mind, earnestly seeking to know more about
the truth of it, and in a spirit of prayer, I studied the Book of
Mormon, little by little, as I completed the weekly assigned seminary
lessons. I remember, like it was yesterday, that a warm feeling gradually
began swelling in my soul and filling my heart, enlightening
my understanding, and becoming more and more delightful, as described 
by Alma in his preaching the word of God to his people. That feeling 
eventually turned into knowledge that took root in my heart and 
became the foundation of my testimony of the significant 
events and teachings found in this sacred book.

<pre><code>Through the scriptures, God does indeed “show forth his power” to save and exalt

<pre><code>I’m sure you can identify the fundamental principles that center
your home on the Savior. The prophetic counsel to have daily
personal and family prayer, daily personal and family scripture
study, and weekly family home evening are the essential,
weight-bearing beams in the construction of a Christ-centered home. Without these regular practices it 
will be difficult to find the desired and much-needed peace and refuge from the world.
