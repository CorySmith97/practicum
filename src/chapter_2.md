# The Power of Jesus Christ and your Covenants

DONE

## Summary

God gives us covenants to push us to become more than we otherwise would be. The covenant 
path is a way to open the heavens to bless us in our mortal existence. Our covenants
are what allow us to become more perfect, and are the only way that we can one day become
like our beloved Father in Heaven or our Savior. The covenant path is also not an exclusive
thing, but rather anyone who is willing to accept and follow it can receive of the same blessings.
It is part of our job as disciples who are walking the covenant path to extend our arms
and raise our voices to find those whom are lost in this world and invite them to walk the path 
of happiness with us. Additionally if we ever step off the path God is waiting for us to get back on.
He will help us to do so, and will be patient for however long that process takes.

### President Oaks: Oct 2023 General Conference | Kingdoms of Glory
```
From such teachings we conclude that the Final Judgment
is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and 
evil acts—what we have done. It is based on the final 
effect of our acts and thoughts—what we have become.
We qualify for eternal life through a process of conversion.
As used here, this word of many meanings signifies a profound change of nature. 
It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. 
The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a 
list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. 
The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become
what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.

### Elder Gong: April 2022 General Conference | We Each Have a Story
```
God wants our families to be happy and forever.
Forever is too long if we make each other unhappy.
Happy is too short if cherished relationships stop with this
life. Through sacred covenants, Jesus Christ offers His love,
power, and grace to change us18 and heal our relationships. 
Selfless temple service for dear ones makes our Savior’s
Atonement real for them and us. Sanctified, we can return
home to God’s presence as families united eternally.
```


### Elder Utchdorf: April 2021 | God Among Us
```
Because of God’s perfect love for us and the eternal sacrifice of 
Jesus Christ, our sins—both great and small—can be blotted out and remembered no more.
We can stand before Him pure, worthy, and sanctified.

### President Erying: Oct 2021 General Conference | The Faith to Ask and Then to Act
```
If your faith in Jesus Christ has led to a heart
softened through the effects of His Atonement, you will
be more able to feel the whisperings of the Spirit in answer 
to your prayers. My personal experience is that the still, 
small voice—which is real—is clear and discernible in my mind
when I feel an internal quiet and submission to the
Lord’s will. That feeling of humility can be 
best described as “Not my will, but thine, be done.”
```

### Elder Rasband: Oct 2020 General Conference | Recommended to the Lord
```
To be “recommended to the Lord” is to be reminded of what 
is expected of a covenant-keeping Latter-day Saint. My 
father-in-law, Blaine, saw it as invaluable preparation 
for the day when he would humbly stand before the Lord.
```

### Elder Christofferson: April 2021 General Conference | Why the Covenant Path
```
Elder J. Golden Kimball is purported to have said,
“I may not have [always] walked the straight and narrow,
but I [try] to cross it as often as I [can].”5 In a more
serious moment, I am sure Brother Kimball would agree that
staying on, not just crossing, the covenant path is our
greatest hope for avoiding avoidable misery on the one hand and successfully 
dealing with the unavoidable woes of life on the other.
```

### Elder Holland: April 2016 General Conference | Tomorrow the Lord will Do Wonders Among You
```
When there was a controversy in the early Church regarding who was
entitled to heaven’s blessings and who wasn’t, the Lord declared to the
Prophet Joseph Smith, “Verily I say unto you, [the gifts of God] are 
given for the benefit of those who love me and keep … my commandments, 
and [for them] that seeketh so to do.” Boy, aren’t we all thankful for that
added provision “and … seeketh so to do”! That has been a lifesaver because
sometimes that is all we can offer! We take some solace in the fact that if
God were to reward only the perfectly faithful, He wouldn’t have much of a distribution list.
```

### Elder Renlund: April 2016 General Conference | "That I Might Draw All Men Unto Me"
```
The closer we are to Jesus Christ in the thoughts and intents of our hearts,
the more we appreciate His innocent suffering, the more grateful we are for 
grace and forgiveness, and the more we want to repent and become like Him. 
Our absolute distance from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is important, 
but the direction we are heading is even more crucial. God is more pleased 
with repentant sinners who are trying to draw closer to Him than with self-righteous, faultfinding individuals who, 
like the Pharisees and scribes of old, do not realize how badly they need to repent.
