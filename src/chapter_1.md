## Summary

### President Nelson: October 2017 General Conference| The Book Of Mormon, Where Would Your Life Be Without It
```
Something powerful happens when a child of God seeks to know more about Him
and His Beloved Son. Nowhere are those truths taught more clearly and powerfully
than in the Book of Mormon.
```


### Elder Renlund: April 2022 General Conference | Your Divine Nature and Eternal Destiny
```
This is intrinsic to who we are. It is spiritually
“genetic,” inherited from our heavenly parents,
and requires no effort on our part. This is our most
important identity, regardless of how else we choose to 
identify ourselves. Understanding this profound truth is
important for everyone but especially for individuals belonging
to groups who have been historically marginalized, oppressed, 
or subjugated. Remember that your most important 
identity relates to your divine nature as a child of God.
```


### President Nelson: April 2012 General Conferece | Thanks Be to God
```
Our Heavenly Father loves His children. He has blessed
each with physical and spiritual gifts. Let me speak of each type.
When you sing “I Am a Child of God,” think of His gift to you of
your own physical body. The many amazing attributes
of your body attest to your own “divine nature.”
