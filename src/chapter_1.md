# Our Divine Identity

## Summary
We are children of God, and that is not something that is simply written in genetics
or is a mortal aspect, but is rather an eternal principle. Written on the very fabric 
of our souls is that fact that we are children of God. With that identity, it is 
important to know that we are also capable of becoming the same as our father in heaven. 
There is quite literally infinite potential in each of us, and it requires us to
live in accordance with God’s laws. Learning to make our divine identity a larger part 
of our lives will change our outlook on life. It allows us to keep an eternal perspective. 
President Nelson said once (quote from a Tad R Callister BYU speech) if we want to help 
cure people from the addictions of life, we need to teach them who they truly are.
This is a powerful statement that knowing who we are helps us make correct decisions.

### President Nelson: October 2017 General Conference| The Book Of Mormon, Where Would Your Life Be Without It
```
Something powerful happens when a child of God seeks to know more about Him
and His Beloved Son. Nowhere are those truths taught more clearly and powerfully
than in the Book of Mormon.
```


### Elder Renlund: April 2022 General Conference | Your Divine Nature and Eternal Destiny
```
This is intrinsic to who we are. It is spiritually
“genetic,” inherited from our heavenly parents,
and requires no effort on our part. This is our most
important identity, regardless of how else we choose to 
identify ourselves. Understanding this profound truth is
important for everyone but especially for individuals belonging
to groups who have been historically marginalized, oppressed, 
or subjugated. Remember that your most important 
identity relates to your divine nature as a child of God.

### President Nelson: April 2012 General Conferece | Thanks Be to God
```
Our Heavenly Father loves His children. He has blessed
each with physical and spiritual gifts. Let me speak of each type.
When you sing “I Am a Child of God,” think of His gift to you of
your own physical body. The many amazing attributes
of your body attest to your own “divine nature.”
```


### President Monson: April 2012 | The Race of Life
```
Our Heavenly Father rejoices for those who keep His commandments. 
He is concerned also for the lost child, the tardy teenager, the wayward
youth, the delinquent parent. Tenderly the Master speaks
to these and indeed to all: “Come back. Come up. Come in. Come home. Come unto me.”
```

### Elder Utchdorf: October 2009 | The Love of God
```
We are created in the image of our heavenly parents; we are God’s spirit
children. Therefore, we have a vast capacity for love—it is part of our spiritual heritage. What and how we 
love not only defines us as individuals; it also defines us as a church.
Love is the defining characteristic of a disciple of Christ.
```

### Elder Oaks: October 2009 | Love and Law
```
The love of God is so universal that His perfect plan bestows
many gifts on all of His children, even those who disobey His 
laws. Mortality is one such gift, bestowed on all who qualified 
in the War in Heaven.6 Another unconditional gift is the universal
resurrection: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall
all be made alive” (1 Corinthians 15:22). Many other mortal gifts
are not tied to our personal obedience to law. As Jesus taught, 
our Heavenly Father “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and 
on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust” (Matthew 5:45).
```

### Elder Cook: April 2009 | Our Father's Plan-Big Enough for All His Children
```
The Savior said: “Let not your heart be troubled. … In my Father’s
house are many mansions. … I go to prepare a place for you.”
A succinct summary is provided in the book of Moses: “For behold,
this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”
```

### Elder Utchdorf: April 2011 | Your Potential, Your Privilage
```
Nevertheless, too often our actions suggest that we live far beneath this potential.
When asked about the priesthood, many of us can recite a correct definition,
but in our daily lives, there may be little evidence that our 
understanding goes beyond the level of a rehearsed script.
```
