# Let God Preveil and Follow his Prophets

## Summary

In this life, God wants nothing more than to be our biggest fan and to support us. 
He has provided a median for us to truly succeed. This includes following his voice piece.
Prophets have been provided out of love to help us to follow God and get better 
support from him. In order to do this however it requires work from us. Some of these 
aspects are not easy however. If we want to let God prevail in our lives, this requires us
to be willing to be chastened. For God chastises those he loves. That includes us. Letting 
God prevail requires work and sometimes growth in order to receive more love and fulfillment.
The only way to end this life and return with him is to let him prevail here while we are 
in the time of our trial, but it is something that will bring us joy as we work towards it.

### President Nelson: April 2022 General Conference | The Power of Spiritual Momentum
```
With frightening speed, a testimony that is not
nourished daily “by the good word of God” can crumble.
Thus, the antidote to Satan’s scheme is clear: we need daily
experiences worshipping the Lord and studying His gospel.
I plead with you to let God prevail in your life. 
Give Him a fair share of your time. As you do, 
notice what happens to your positive spiritual momentum.

### Elder Anderson: April 2020 General Conference | Spiritually Defining Moments
```
Embrace your sacred memories. Believe them. Write
them down. Share them with your family. Trust that
they come to you from your Heavenly Father and His 
Beloved Son. Let them bring patience to your doubts 
and understanding to your difficulties. I promise you
that as you willingly acknowledge and carefully treasure
the spiritually defining events in your life, more and more will come 
to you. Heavenly Father knows you and loves you!

### Elder Christofferson: Oct 2021 General Conference | The Love of God
```
This divine love should give us abundant
comfort and confidence as we pray to the Father in
the name of Christ. Not one of us is a stranger to Them.
We need not hesitate to call upon God, even when we feel
unworthy. We can rely on the mercy and merits of Jesus 
Christ to be heard.6 As we abide in God’s love, we depend
less and less on the approval of others to guide us.
```

### President Monson: April 2012 General Conference | The Race of Life

```
Our Heavenly Father did not launch us on our eternal
voyage without providing the means whereby we could 
receive from Him guidance to ensure our safe return. 
I speak of prayer. I speak too of the whisperings from 
that still, small voice; and I do not overlook the holy 
scriptures, which contain the word of the Lord and the words of the prophets—provided
to us to help us successfully cross the finish line.
```

### Elder Utchdorf: October 2023 General Conference | The Prodigal and the Road that Leads Home
```
Our Heavenly Father will run to us, His heart overflowing 
with love and compassion. He will embrace us; place a 
robe around our shoulders, a ring on our finger,
and sandals on our feet; and proclaim, “Today we celebrate! 
For my child, who once was dead, has come back to life!”
```

### President Nelson: April 2020 General Conference| Hear Him
```
The very first word in the Doctrine and Covenants is
hearken. It means “to listen with the intent to obey.”
To hearken means to “hear Him”—to hear what the Savior says
and then to heed His counsel. In those two words—“Hear Him”—God 
gives us the pattern for success, happiness, and 
joy in this life. We are to hear the words of the Lord,
hearken to them, and heed what He has told us!
```

### Elder Christofferson: Oct 2019 | The Joy of the Saints
```
God sees things in their true perspective, and
He shares that perspective with us through His commandments,
effectively guiding us around the pitfalls and potholes of mortality
toward eternal joy. The Prophet Joseph Smith explained: “Whe
n His commandments teach us, it is in view of eternity; for
we are looked upon by God as though we were in eternity; God dwells
in eternity, and does not view things as we do.”
```

### Elder Christofferson: April 2011 | "As Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten"
```
 It is this: willingly to accept and even seek correction. Correction 
 is vital if we would conform our lives “unto a perfect man, [that is,]
 unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13).
 Paul said of divine correction or chastening, “For whom the Lord 
 loveth he chasteneth” (Hebrews 12:6). Though it is often difficult to endure, 
 truly we ought to rejoice that God considers us worth the time and trouble to correct.
