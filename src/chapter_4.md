# Teaching Truth with Love

## Summary
When we interact with others in our lives, there are many times that we 
will have trials to share what we believe. However there is power in trusting
in the Lord. When we are filled with the love of God, it is much easier to
share what we know to be true. When those we love and care about those who 
disagree with us, we are able to open our hearts and fearlessly share truth.
Moroni shared that perfect love casteth out all fear, and that is something 
that I have seen a lot of the apostle share. Charity however is something 
that is a gift from God. We need our father in heaven to share that ability
to truly love others, and it is also a practiced skill. It is not easy but 
it is a powerful change that we all must go through. Patience is also one 
of the key skills to develop if we want to be able to 
share truth with love and help make changes in peoples lives.

### Elder Gong: Oct 2023 General Conferece | Love is Spoken Here
```
The words we use can draw us closer to or distance us
from other Christians and friends. Sometimes we speak of
missionary work, temple work, humanitarian and welfare 
work in ways that may cause others to think we believe 
we work on our own. Let us always speak with warm and 
reverent gratitude for God’s work and glory and the merits, mercy, 
and grace of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.
```


### Elder Utchdorf: Oct 2008 General Conference | Lift Where you Stand
```
But sometimes we do not hear the rest of what the Lord
is telling us. “Although you are worthy to serve in this
position,” He may say, “this is not my calling for you. It is my desire instead that you
lift where you stand.” God knows what is best for us.
```


### Elder Holland: Oct 2022 General Conference | Lifted Up on the Cross
```
As we take up our crosses and follow Him, it would be tragic 
indeed if the weight of our challenges did not make us more
empathetic for and more attentive to the burdens being carried 
by others. It is one of the most powerful paradoxes of the
Crucifixion that the arms of the Savior were stretched wide 
open and then nailed there, unwittingly but accurately portraying 
that every man, woman, and child in the entire human family is not only welcome
but invited into His redeeming, exalting embrace.

### Elder Hales: April 2017 General Conference | Becoming a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ
```
This patience, Peter teaches, leads us to godliness. As the Father 
is patient with us, His children, we become patient with one another 
and ourselves. We delight in the agency of others and the opportunity
it gives them to grow “line upon line,” “brighter and brighter until the perfect day.”
```

### Elder Utchdorf: April 2017 | The Greatest Among You
```
I can almost see the Savior, looking with infinite love into the faces of those faithful
and believing disciples. I can almost hear His pleading voice:
“This is not the way it shall be among you. Instead, whosoever will be great among you, 
shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.”
```

### Elder Christofferson: April 2017 | The Voice of Warning
```
We who have received a knowledge of the great plan of happiness—and 
its implementing commandments—should feel a desire to share that knowledge
since it makes all the difference here and in eternity. And if we ask, 
“Who is my neighbor that I should warn?” surely the answer will be found in a parable that begins,
“A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves,” and so forth.
```

### President Nelson: October 2002 | "Blessed are the Peacemakers"
```
This concept of treating others as one would like to be treated is
easy to understand. And it acknowledges the precious nature of each 
of God’s sons and daughters.19 Scripture asks parents to teach 
children not to “fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin.” 
Instead, we “teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.”
```

### President Erying: October 2015 | You are Not Alone in the Work
```
There will be times in your service when you won’t have the remarkable
and visible success of that young elders quorum president. That is 
the time when you will need to be confident that the Lord, knowing you
would do your part in the work, called you through His authorized 
servants. Having faith in the call from the Lord’s servants
was crucial in the missionary service of my great-grandfather Henry Eyring.
