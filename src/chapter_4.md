## Summary: 

### Elder Gong: Oct 2023 General Conferece | Love is Spoken Here
```
The words we use can draw us closer to or distance us
from other Christians and friends. Sometimes we speak of
missionary work, temple work, humanitarian and welfare 
work in ways that may cause others to think we believe 
we work on our own. Let us always speak with warm and 
reverent gratitude for God’s work and glory and the merits, mercy, 
and grace of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.
```


### Elder Utchdorf: Oct 2008 General Conference | Lift Where you Stand
```
But sometimes we do not hear the rest of what the Lord
is telling us. “Although you are worthy to serve in this
position,” He may say, “this is not my calling for you. It is my desire instead that you
lift where you stand.” God knows what is best for us.
```


### Elder Holland: Oct 2022 General Conference | Lifted Up on the Cross
```
As we take up our crosses and follow Him, it would be tragic 
indeed if the weight of our challenges did not make us more
empathetic for and more attentive to the burdens being carried 
by others. It is one of the most powerful paradoxes of the
Crucifixion that the arms of the Savior were stretched wide 
open and then nailed there, unwittingly but accurately portraying 
that every man, woman, and child in the entire human family is not only welcome
but invited into His redeeming, exalting embrace.
```


### Elder Hales: April 2017 General Conference | Becoming a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ
```
This patience, Peter teaches, leads us to godliness. As the Father 
is patient with us, His children, we become patient with one another 
and ourselves. We delight in the agency of others and the opportunity
it gives them to grow “line upon line,” “brighter and brighter until the perfect day.”
```

### Elder Utchdorf: April 2017 | The Greatest Among You
```
I can almost see the Savior, looking with infinite love into the faces of those faithful
and believing disciples. I can almost hear His pleading voice:
“This is not the way it shall be among you. Instead, whosoever will be great among you, 
shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.”
```

```
We who have received a knowledge of the great plan of happiness—and 
its implementing commandments—should feel a desire to share that knowledge
since it makes all the difference here and in eternity. And if we ask, 
“Who is my neighbor that I should warn?” surely the answer will be found in a parable that begins,
“A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves,” and so forth.
