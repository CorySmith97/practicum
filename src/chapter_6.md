# Repetance is Joyful

DONE
## Summary

Upon finishing and reviewing this section of scripture that I have found
I feel impressed that if I am to continually find joy in repentance, I need to 
strive to cherish those things that Christ has done for me that allow me to repent.
These things include the atoning sacrifice he made for all of us. The main way I need to
remember his sacrifice is through the sacrament. However it is not as simple as 
merely taking the sacrament each week, but it comes from communicating with 
the Lord prior to renewing my covenants. It also comes from being as prepared 
as I can be for the ordinance on a weekly basis. I should arrive early, and 
participate. Listen to the speakers and the music. Another impression I have
had is that I can pray that the Lord will continually fill me with the Joy of repentance
as I participate daily in the practice. I feel strongly that the Lord will bless me to find
the Joy of repentance daily once again. 

### Elder Renlund: Oct 2022 General Conference | A Framework for Personal Repentence
```
If we have repented, been filled with joy and peace of conscience, 
and received a remission of our sins, we do not need to ask again
but can trust the answer God has already given.
```


### Elder Holland: Oct 2021 General Conference | The Greatest Possesssion
```
Of course, we all have some habits or flaws or personal
history that could keep us from complete spiritual immersion
in this work. But God is our Father and is exceptionally 
good at forgiving and forgetting sins we have forsaken, 
perhaps because we give Him so much practice in doing so. 
In any case, there is divine help for every one of 
us at any hour we feel to make a change in our behavior.

### Elder Soares: April 2021 General Conference | Jesus Christ: The Caregiver of the Soul
```
My dear friends, I testify to you that as we genuinely repent of our sins,
we allow the atoning sacrifice of Christ to become wholly effective in our life.
We will become free from the bondage of sin, find joy in our
earthly journey, and become eligible to receive eternal salvation,
which was prepared from the foundation of the world 
for all who believe in Jesus Christ and come unto Him.
```


### Elder Renlund: April 2022 General Conference | Your Divine Nature and Eternal Destiny
```
Even after sincere repentance, however, we may stumble.
Stumbling does not mean that the repentance was inadequate 
but may simply reflect human weakness. How comforting to know 
that “the Lord sees weaknesses differently than He [sees] 
rebellion.” We should not doubt the Savior’s ability to help us with our weaknesses, because “when the 
Lord speaks of weaknesses, it is always with mercy.”
```

### Elder Christofferson: October 2010 General Conference | Reflections on a Consecrated Life
```
Consecration therefore means repentance. Stubbornness, rebellion,
and rationalization must be abandoned, and in their place submission,
a desire for correction, and acceptance of all that the Lord may require. 
This is what King Benjamin called putting off the natural man, yielding
to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and becoming “a saint through the
atonement of Christ the Lord” (Mosiah 3:19). Such a one is promised
the enduring presence of the Holy Spirit, a promise remembered 
and renewed each time a repentant soul partakes of the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper
```

### Elder Anderson: October 2010 General Conference | Never Leave Him
```
The beautiful lesson we learn from Frederick G. Williams is that “whatever his personal
weaknesses, he had the strength of character to [renew] his loyalty to the [Lord,] the
Prophet and … to the Church, when it would have been so easy to have disintegrated in 
bitterness.” In the spring of 1840, he presented himself at a general conference,
humbly asking forgiveness for his past conduct and expressing his determination to do the will of God in the future. His case was presented 
by Hyrum Smith, and he was freely forgiven. He died a faithful member of the Church.
```

### President Oaks: October 2010 General Conference | Two Lines of Communication
```
Similarly, we cannot communicate reliably through the direct, personal line
if we are disobedient to or out of harmony with the priesthood line. The 
Lord has declared that “the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness”
```

### Elder Cook: April 2010 General Conference | We Follow Jesus Christ
```
If we are to be His disciples and to be committed members of His Church,
we must remember and reverence the sacrament. It allows each of us to express
with broken hearts and contrite spirits our willingness to follow the
Savior, to repent, and to become a Saint through the Atonement of Christ.
The sacrament allows us to witness to God that we will remember His
Son and keep His commandments as we renew our baptismal covenant.
This increases our love and appreciation for both the Father and the Son.
