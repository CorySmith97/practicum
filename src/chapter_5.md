## Summary

### Elder Bednar: September 2007 Ensign | Seek Learning by Faith
```
Nephi teaches us, “When a man speaketh by the power of
the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth 
[the message] unto the hearts of the children of men” 
(2 Nephi 33:1). Please notice how the power of the 
Spirit carries the message unto but not necessarily 
into the heart. A teacher can explain, demonstrate, 
persuade, and testify, and do so with great spiritual 
power and effectiveness. Ultimately, however, the content 
of a message and the witness of the Holy Ghost penetrate 
into the heart only if a receiver allows them to enter. 
Learning by faith opens the pathway into the heart.
```


### President Monson: Oct 2014 General Conference | Ponder the Path of thy Feet
```
We need not walk by the shores of Galilee or among
the Judean hills to walk where Jesus walked. All of us
can walk the path He walked when, with His words ringing
in our ears, His Spirit filling our hearts, and His
teachings guiding our lives, we choose to follow Him
as we journey through mortality. His example lights the way.
Said He, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.”
