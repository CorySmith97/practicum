# Take Charge of Your Testimony

## Summary
We cannot survive this life without developing a testimony of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ. This testimony is built slowly day by day living the gospel.
We can also develop this testimony by trying to live the commandments and 
noticing the differences in our lives. If we want to maintain a testimony 
that we have developed we need to write down our experiences in order to 
remind ourselves what the Lord has taught us. There are also small things 
that we need to continually maintain. The Gospel requires us to be active 
participants. Part of being an active member of gospel living, we need to 
share what we have learned. As we share the holy Ghost has the opportunity 
to share to our own hearts as well as the hearts of others. It is vital to 
remember that if we do not listen to the holy Ghost, we cannot 
learn of any spiritual things, for it is by the spirit that God teaches us.

### Elder Bednar: September 2007 Ensign | Seek Learning by Faith
```
Nephi teaches us, “When a man speaketh by the power of
the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth 
[the message] unto the hearts of the children of men” 
(2 Nephi 33:1). Please notice how the power of the 
Spirit carries the message unto but not necessarily 
into the heart. A teacher can explain, demonstrate, 
persuade, and testify, and do so with great spiritual 
power and effectiveness. Ultimately, however, the content 
of a message and the witness of the Holy Ghost penetrate 
into the heart only if a receiver allows them to enter. 
Learning by faith opens the pathway into the heart.

### President Monson: October 2014 General Conference | Ponder the Path of thy Feet
```
We need not walk by the shores of Galilee or among
the Judean hills to walk where Jesus walked. All of us
can walk the path He walked when, with His words ringing
in our ears, His Spirit filling our hearts, and His
teachings guiding our lives, we choose to follow Him
as we journey through mortality. His example lights the way.
Said He, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.”
```

### Elder Bednar: April 2008 | Ask In Faith
```
The Prophet Joseph further explained that “faith is not only the
principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings,
whether in heaven or on earth” (Lectures on Faith, 3). Thus, 
faith in Christ leads to righteous action, which increases our 
spiritual capacity and power. Understanding that faith is a 
principle of action and of power inspires us to exercise our
moral agency in compliance with gospel truth, invites the redeeming 
and strengthening powers of the Savior’s Atonement into our lives, and enlarges the 
power within us whereby we are agents unto ourselves (see D&C 58:28).
```


### Elder Bednar: October 2020 | We Will Prove THem Herewith
```
Faithfulness is not foolishness or fanaticism. Rather, it is
trusting and placing our confidence in Jesus Christ as our Savior, on 
His name, and in His promises. As we “press forward with a steadfastness in 
Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men,”
we are blessed with an eternal perspective and vision that stretches far beyond
our limited mortal capacity. We will be enabled to “gather together, and stand in holy places” 
and “be not moved, until the day of the Lord come.”
```

### President Nelson: October 2020 | Embrace the Future with Faith
```
Simply said, a place of security is anywhere you can feel the 
presence of the Holy Ghost and be guided by Him.
When the Holy Ghost is with you, you can teach truth, even when it 
runs counter to prevailing opinions. And you can ponder sincere
questions about the gospel in an environment of revelation.
```

### Elder Andersen: October 2023 | Tithing: Opening the Windows of Heaven
```
With all the Lord gives to us, He has asked us to return to Him and His kingdom
on earth 10 percent of our increase. He has promised us that as we are honest in 
our tithes, He will “open … the windows of heaven, and pour … out a blessing,
that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” He has promised us that
He will protect us from evil. These promises are so certain,4 the Lord declares, “Prove me now herewith,”
a phrase found nowhere else in the scriptures but when quoting Malachi.
```

### President Nelson: October 2023 | Think Celestial
```
Mortality is a master class in learning to choose the things of greatest
eternal import. Far too many people live as though this life is all 
there is. However, your choices today will determine three things:
where you will live throughout all eternity, the kind of body with which you 
will be resurrected, and those with whom you will live forever. So, think celestial.
```

### Elder Rasband: April 2023 | Hosanna to the Most High God
```
Second, the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Smith taught, “No man
can know that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.” The Savior promised 
His disciples15 at the Last Supper16 in the upper room, “I will not 
leave you comfortless.” They would not be alone to carry the truths of 
the gospel forward but would have the consummate gift of the Holy Ghost 
to guide them. “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,” He promised; 
“not as the world giveth, give I unto you.” With the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, we have that same assurance—that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us]”
and “by the power of the Holy Ghost [we] may know the truth of all things.”
