# Scriptures, the Font of Living Water

## Summary 

The scriptures are the Lord's counsel for the world. Without the daily 
immersion of the scriptures how can we ever truly come to know the
Lord. The Book of Mormon is God's most pure form of written word. God
expects us and has counseled us on countless occasions that we should
imemerse ourselves in these words. When we want to speak with the Lord we
pray, but when we want the Lord to speak with us we should open the scriptures.
One of the most important things I was reminded in this topic is that we have 
prophetic promises that as we read the Book of Mormon daily, we will make better
decisions daily. Another important thing is that if the apostles have need to 
study daily we have just as large a need to do the same. There is also profound 
promises that reading the scriptures with those we love will improve relationships
and bring peace into families or households.

### President Nelson: Oct 2017 General Conference | The Book of Mormon, Where would your life be without it.
```
My dear brothers and sisters, I promise that as you 
prayerfully study the Book of Mormon every day, you 
will make better decisions—every day. I promise that as you 
ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, 
and you will receive answers to your own questions and 
direction for your own life. I promise that as you daily 
immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized 
against the evils of the day, even the gripping 
plague of pornography and other mind-numbing addictions.

### Elder Bednar: Feb 2007 BYU Speech | A Reservoir of Living Water
```
The scriptures contain the words of Christ and are a 
reservoir of living water to which we have ready access 
and from which we can drink deeply and long. You and 
I must look to and come unto Christ, who is “the fountain 
of living waters” (1 Nephi 11:25; compare Ether 8:26, 12:28),
by reading (see Mosiah 1:5), studying (see D&C 26:1), 
searching (see John 5:39; Alma 17:2), and feasting (see 2 Nephi 32:3) 
upon the words of Christ as contained in the holy scriptures. 
By so doing, we can receive both spiritual
direction and protection during our mortal journey.

### Elder Soares: April 2020 General Conference | The Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon
```
With that promise in mind, earnestly seeking to know more about
the truth of it, and in a spirit of prayer, I studied the Book of
Mormon, little by little, as I completed the weekly assigned seminary
lessons. I remember, like it was yesterday, that a warm feeling gradually
began swelling in my soul and filling my heart, enlightening
my understanding, and becoming more and more delightful, as described 
by Alma in his preaching the word of God to his people. That feeling 
eventually turned into knowledge that took root in my heart and 
became the foundation of my testimony of the significant 
events and teachings found in this sacred book.

### Elder Scott: October 2011 | The Power of Scripture
```
Scriptures are like packets of light that illuminate
our minds and give place to guidance and inspiration 
from on high. They can become the key to open the 
channel to communion with our Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.
```

### Elder Christofferson: April 2010 | The Blessing of Scriptures
```
Through the scriptures, God does indeed “show forth his power” to save and exalt 
His children. By His word, as Alma said, He enlarges our memory,
sheds light on falsehood and error, and brings us to repentance and to rejoice in Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.
```

### Elder Scott: April 2013 | For Peace at Home
```
I’m sure you can identify the fundamental principles that center
your home on the Savior. The prophetic counsel to have daily
personal and family prayer, daily personal and family scripture
study, and weekly family home evening are the essential,
weight-bearing beams in the construction of a Christ-centered home. Without these regular practices it 
will be difficult to find the desired and much-needed peace and refuge from the world.
```

### President Nelson: April 2013 | Catch the Wave
```
The book of Doctrine and Covenants contains many additional revelations
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Through him we have received more
pages of scripture than we have from any other prophet. In
what must have been a wistful moment, he said to the Saints in Nauvoo, Illinois,
“I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught.”
```

### President Nelson: October 2007 | Scriptural Witnesses
```
Love for the Book of Mormon expands one’s love for the Bible and vice versa.
Scriptures of the Restoration do not compete with the Bible; they complement
the Bible. We are indebted to martyrs who gave their lives so that we could
have the Bible. It establishes the everlasting nature of the gospel and of
the plan of happiness. The Book of Mormon restores and underscores biblical 
doctrines such as tithing, the temple, the Sabbath day, and the priesthood.
