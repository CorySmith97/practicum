# Diligence in Gospel Living

## Summary
When it comes to living the Gospel it is the small things that
provide the most powerful impact. It is through making decisions on a 
daily basis including scriptures, tithing, prayer and taking the sacrament that
we can find the strength to continue forward. Being Diligent is a continual 
effort, but that does not mean that we need to be perfect. Another impactful thing 
I have learned in this is that what point is there in living diligently to
uplift our own lives if we do not make efforts to raise those around us
up as well. Gospel living should be focused on others, and as we do that
our own lives and devotion to God will grow. hat is where much of unshakable
testimonies are grown. Once we know what we feel is true, we should then do 
everything daily to share what we have learned. God will enlighten our
lives and those around us. That is where much of the power of diligence comes from.

### President Oaks: Oct 2018 April General Conference | Small and Simple Things
```
None of these desirable small and simple things will lift us to
great things unless they are practiced consistently and continuously.
President Brigham Young was reported as saying:
“Our lives are made up of little, simple circumstances that amount
to a great deal when they are brought together,
and sum up the whole life of the man or woman.”
```


### Elder Anderson: Oct 2008 | You Know Enough
```
We then remain steady and patient as we progress
through mortality. At times, the Lord’s answer will be,
“You don’t know everything, but you know enough”—enough to
keep the commandments and to do what is right.
Remember Nephi’s words: “I know that he loveth his children;
nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.”
```


### Elder Scott: October 2010 | The Transforming Power of Faith and Character
```
We become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become
each day. Righteous character is a precious manifestation of what you are
becoming. Righteous character is more valuable than any material object
you own, any knowledge you have gained through study, or any goals you
have attained no matter how well lauded by mankind. In the next life your righteous 
character will be evaluated to assess how well you used the privilege of mortality.
```

### President Oaks: April 2015 | Parable of the Sower
```
Young people, if that teaching seems too general, here is a specific
example. If the emblems of the sacrament are being passed and you are 
texting or whispering or playing video games or doing anything else to 
deny yourself essential spiritual food, you are severing your spiritual 
roots and moving yourself toward stony ground. You are making yourself 
vulnerable to withering away when you encounter tribulation 
like isolation, intimidation, or ridicule. And that applies to adults also.
```

### Elder Renlund: April 2020 | Consider the Goodness and Greatness of God
```
Every time we use, benefit from, or even think of these gifts,
we ought to consider the sacrifice, generosity, and 
compassion of the givers. Reverence for the givers does more
than just make us grateful. Reflecting on Their gifts can and should transform us.
```

### President Erying: April 2020 | He Goes Before Us
```
The Lord let us make improvements to help people gain
feelings of familiarity and even love for their ancestors 
and complete their temple ordinances. Now, as the Lord 
surely knew would happen, young people are becoming computer 
mentors to their parents and ward members. All have found great joy in this service.
```

### Elder Utchdorf: April 2015 | On Being Genuine
```
I wonder if our organizational and personal goals are sometimes 
the modern equivalent of a Potemkin village. Do they look impressive 
from a distance but fail to address the real needs of our beloved fellowmen?
```

### President Erying: April 2012 | Mountains to Climb
```
One of the keys to an enduring faith is to judge correctly 
the curing time required. That is why I was unwise to pray so
soon in my life for higher mountains to climb and greater tests.
```
