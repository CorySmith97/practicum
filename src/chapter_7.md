## Summary

### President Oaks: Oct 2018 April General Conference | Small and Simple Things
```
None of these desirable small and simple things will lift us to
great things unless they are practiced consistently and continuously.
President Brigham Young was reported as saying:
“Our lives are made up of little, simple circumstances that amount
to a great deal when they are brought together,
and sum up the whole life of the man or woman.”
```


### Elder Anderson: Oct 2008 | You Know Enough
```
We then remain steady and patient as we progress
through mortality. At times, the Lord’s answer will be,
“You don’t know everything, but you know enough”—enough to
keep the commandments and to do what is right.
Remember Nephi’s words: “I know that he loveth his children;
nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.”
```


### Elder Scott: October 2010 | The Transforming Power of Faith and Character
```
We become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become
each day. Righteous character is a precious manifestation of what you are
becoming. Righteous character is more valuable than any material object
you own, any knowledge you have gained through study, or any goals you
have attained no matter how well lauded by mankind. In the next life your righteous 
character will be evaluated to assess how well you used the privilege of mortality.
